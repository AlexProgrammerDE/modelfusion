# Recipes

Here you can find recipes and prompts for various use cases that you can use as a starting point for your own prompts.

> ℹ️ ModelFusion itself does not include prompts, because they depend on the models that you use and need to be adapted to your use case. Including them in the library would mean that your app could break if we change the library prompts, and they might not work with the models that you use.
