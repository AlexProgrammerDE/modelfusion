# Tutorials

Here you can find tutorial for various use cases that you can use as a starting point for your own programs and prompts.

:::note
ModelFusion itself does not include prompts, because they depend on the models that you use and need to be adapted to your use case. Including them in the library would mean that your app could break if we change the library prompts, and they might not work with the models that you use.
