# WhisperWriter

[WhisperWriter](https://github.com/lgrammel/whisperwriter) is a local, private voice controlled notepad. Voice activity detection (VAD) and speech-to-text (STT) are run locally on your machine. WhisperWriter always listens while it's running, and automatically transcribes what you say when it's active.
